# File
#     etc/config.sh/mgridgen
#
# Description
#     Setup file for MGridGen include/libraries.
#     Sourced during wmake process only.
#
#     Normally used to specify the MGridGen version and location for a
#     ThirdParty installation.
#
#     If using system-wide installations, use the following setting:
#
#         MGRIDGEN_VERSION=mgridgen-system
#
#     If the system mgridgen is unusable and you don't have or want
#     a ThirdParty installation:
#
#         MGRIDGEN_VERSION=mgridgen-none
#
#     If using a central installation, but not located under ThirdParty:
#         - specify mgridgen-system
#         - provide full path for MGRIDGEN_ARCH_PATH
#
# Note
#     A csh version is not needed, since the values here are only sourced
#     during the wmake process.
#
#     MGridGen can be entirely disabled, by either renaming this file or
#     by creating an empty one with the same name at a user or site location.
