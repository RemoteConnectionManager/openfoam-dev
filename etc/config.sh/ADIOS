# File
#     etc/config.sh/ADIOS
#
# Description
#     Setup file for ADIOS include/libraries.
#     Sourced from OpenFOAM-<VERSION>/etc/bashrc
#
#     If using system-wide installations, use the following settings:
#
#         adios_version=adios-system
#
#     If the system adios is unusable (eg, too old) and you don't
#     have or want a ThirdParty installation:
#
#         adios_version=adios-none
#
#     If using a central installation, but not located under ThirdParty:
#         - specify adios-system
#         - provide full paths for ADIOS_ARCH_PATH
#
# Note
#     Since ADIOS is a static library build, the libraries are renamed
#     for the appropriate MPI. Eg, libadios_openmpi-system
#
