# File

#
# Description
#     Setup file for metis include/libraries.
#     Sourced during wmake process only.
#
#     Normally used to specify the metis version and location for a
#     ThirdParty installation.
#
#     If using system-wide installations, use the following setting:
#
#         METIS_VERSION=metis-system
#
#     If the system metis is unusable (eg, too old) and you don't
#     have or want a ThirdParty installation:
#
#         METIS_VERSION=metis-none
#
#     If using a central installation, but not located under ThirdParty:
#         - specify metis-system
#         - provide full path for METIS_ARCH_PATH
#
# Note
#     A csh version is not needed, since the values here are only sourced
#     during the wmake process.
#
#     Metis can also be entirely disabled, by either renaming this file or
#     by creating an empty one with the same name at a user or site location.
